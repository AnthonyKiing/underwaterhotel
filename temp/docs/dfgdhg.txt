Activities abound for adventurers who wish to explore the unimaginable, 
like maneuvering a personal Triton submarine through a lagoon, 
exploring the ocean’s depths as the passenger of a 1,000-foot luxury submersible, 
and scuba diving in pristine waters. 
Those who seek solitude will find the epitome of relaxation when indulging in 
marine-focused spa treatments and meditation under the gaze of only the moon and stars. 
Whether traveling alone, as a pair, or in a group, you will find what you seek.

             
Services available include two fine dining establishments, 
one on land and one below the sea, presenting plates of culinary excellence day and night. 
A dive shop and retail boutique will also be at your service, along with a library/lounge, 
theater area and conference room/wedding chapel. 
Fitness amenities include a nine-hole executive golf course, tennis courts, private 
splash pools and a fitness center.
